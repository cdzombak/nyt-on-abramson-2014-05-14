    "body": "<div id=\"copy\"><p>Jill Abramson, the executive editor of The New York Times, is unexpectedly leaving the position and will be replaced by Dean Baquet, the managing editor of the newspaper, the company said on Wednesday.</p> <p>In announcing the sudden switch to a stunned newsroom, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the publisher of the paper and the chairman of The New York Times Company, attributed it to “an issue with management in the newsroom.”</p> <p>Ms. Abramson, 60, a former investigative correspondent and Washington editor who was appointed to lead the newsroom in 2011, was the first woman to serve in the top job.</p> <p>“I’ve loved my run at The Times,” she said in a statement. “I got to work with the best journalists in the world doing so much stand-up journalism,” she added, noting her appointment of many senior female editors as one of her achievements.</p> <p>Mr. Sulzberger informed senior editors of the change in a gathering in a conference room Wednesday afternoon, and shortly afterward addressed hundreds of staff members gathered on the newsroom floor and the staircases surrounding it. He began by praising Mr. Baquet, but declined to directly address the question he said was “on all of your minds” – the reason for the sudden switch. Citing newsroom management, he said it was not about the journalism, the direction of the newsroom or the relationship between the newsroom and business sides of the paper.</p> <p>Mr. Baquet received a minute-long round of applause from employees still trying to digest the news. “It feels like both a wedding and a funeral,” said one staff member.</p> <p>Mr. Baquet, 57, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and a former editor of The Los Angeles Times, will become the first African-American executive editor at The New York Times. “It is an honor to be asked to lead the only newsroom in the country that is actually better than it was a generation ago,” he said, “one that approaches the world with wonder and ambition every day.”</p> <p>“There is no journalist in our newsroom or elsewhere better qualified to take on the responsibilities of executive editor at this time than Dean Baquet,” Mr. Sulzberger said in a statement. “He is an exceptional reporter and editor with impeccable news judgment who enjoys the confidence and support of his colleagues around the world and across the organization.”</p> </div>",
