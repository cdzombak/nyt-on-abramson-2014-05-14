She joined The Times in 1997.</p> <p>“I’ve loved my run at The Times,” she said in a statement. “I got to work with the best journalists in the world doing so much stand-up journalism,” she added, noting her appointment of many senior female editors as one of her achievements.</p> <p>Mr. Sulzberger informed senior editors of the change in a gathering in a conference room Wednesday afternoon, and shortly afterward addressed hundreds of staff members gathered on the newsroom floor and the staircases surrounding it. He began by praising Mr. Baquet, but declined to elaborate on the question he said was “on all of your minds” – the reason for the sudden switch. Citing newsroom management, he said it was not about the journalism, the direction of the newsroom or the relationship between the newsroom and business sides of the paper.</p> <p>“I chose to appoint a new leader for our newsroom because I believe that new leadership will improve some aspects of the management of the newsroom,” he said. “You will understand that there is nothing more that I want to say about this. We had an issue with management in the newsroom. And that’s what’s at the heart of this issue.”</p> <p>Mr. Baquet then addressed the staff, and received a minute-long round of applause from employees still trying to digest the news. “It feels like both a wedding and a funeral,” said one staff member.</p> <p>Mr. Baquet, 57, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and a former editor of The Los Angeles Times, will become the first African-American executive editor at The New York Times. “It is an honor to be asked to lead the only newsroom in the country that is actually better than it was a generation ago,” he said, “one that approaches the world with wonder and ambition every day.”</p> <p>“There is no journalist in our newsroom or elsewhere better qualified to take on the responsibilities of executive editor at this time than Dean Baquet,” Mr. Sulzberger said in a statement. “He is an exceptional reporter and editor with impeccable news judgment who enjoys the confidence and support of his colleagues around the world and across the organization.”</p> <p>The appointment represented the second time in the last 11 years that Mr. Sulzberger has made a sudden change in leadership. In 2003, he dismissed Howell Raines amid a furor over plagiarized articles by a reporter, Jayson Blair.</p> </div>",
